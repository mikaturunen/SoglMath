A Simple header only Math library with some basic funcitonality.
The aim of the header lib is to be easy to use, just include into your project
and start using. Modify, use, tinker, play with it.. do what you want with it really :)

The vectors use right-hand coordinate system. Geared towards math/simulation/3D rendering 
use. Especially coupled with OpenGL.


Currently supports:
- Vector 2D class and common operations
- Vector 3D class and common operations



Future plans: 
Math:
	- Side checks for directional Vector (2D)
	- Matrix operations (opengl context)
Geometry:
	- Simple polygons (convex)
	- Lines 
	- Planes
	
	
It's still very much under work but it'll get there. It's a submodule of a bigger
project and it gets modified when need for more support or modifications arise.
